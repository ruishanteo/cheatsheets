## Software Engineering

-   “Software engineering is an **engineering discipline** that is concerned with all aspects of software production from initial conception to operation and maintenance.” (Sommerville)
    -   Engineering is about selectively using theories, methods, and tools where appropriate
-   No silver bullet (1986)
    -   Fred Brooks 1931-2022
    -   “There is no single development, in either technology or in management technique, that itself promises even **one order-of-magnitude improvement** in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.”
    -   “I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation. [...] If this is true, **building software will always be hard**. There is inherently no silver bullet.”

### Software Engineering Activities

Central software engineering activities:

-   Software specification
    -   The functionality of the software and contraints on its operation must be defined
-   Software development
    -   The software to meet the specification must be produced
-   Software validation
    -   The software must be validated to ensure it does what the customer wants
-   Software evolution
    -   The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs

Two general perspectives:

### Software Process Models

## Requirements Engineering

## Software Architecture

## System Modeling

## Agile Software Development
