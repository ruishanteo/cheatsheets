## 2: Research Methods

### What is Research

-   Process of gaining information in order to come to a conclusion
-   Goals
    -   Measurement and description
    -   Understanding and prediction
    -   Application and control
-   Guiding principles
    -   Rationalism
    -   Empiricism: taking observations through senses and forming conclusions

### Scientific Method

0. Get to know topic
    - Observation (direct or indirect)
1. Formulate a hypothesis
    - To be stated in terms of an operational definition
2. Design the study
    - Quasi-experiment: looks like an experiment, but independent variable has not been manipulated by experimenter
    - Non-experiment: naturalistic observation, case studies, surveys
    - Experiment: can make causal conclusions
    - Ethics should be considered
3. Collect the data
4. Analyze the data: draw conclusions
    - Descriptive statistics
        - Central tendency (mean, median, mode)
        - Correlation (r = .2: negligible, .5: moderate, .8: very strong, 1: perfect)
        - Inferential statistics (chi-test, F-test), used to tell probability that results were due to chance
5. Report the findings

### Experiments

-   To determine causality
-   Manipulate a variable, hold all other variables steady
-   Random assignment: decreases chances that your groups differ from one another before the manipulation
-   Extraneous variables: variables which may influence results though you are not interested in the effects (factor has been "controlled for")
-   Confounding variables: variables that influences results and make them unclear

### Research Challenges

-   Sampling bias (size)
-   Experimenter expectation/ bias
-   Participant expectation/ bias
-   Single-blind & double-blind studies

## 3: Biological Bases

### Terms

-   Soma: body of the cell which contains all organelles
-   Oligo (small/ a few) + dendro (tree-like branches)
-   Myelin sheath: insulating layer, or sheath that forms around nerves; allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly along the nerve cells
-   Glia ("glue" of the brain)
    -   Oligodendrocytes (CNS): one cell can create several segments of myelin sheath and cover more than one axon
    -   Schwann cells (PNS): one cell creates only one segment of myelin sheath for only one axon
    -   Astrocytes: synchronizes communication between neurons, nurtures cells, and removes waste products
    -   Microglia: functions as part of immune system, removes waste products and invaders
    -   Radial glia: guides migration and growth of immature neurons

### Types of neural signals

-   Synapses
    -   Axo-dendritic: connection formed between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another
    -   Axo-somatic: axon-soma
    -   Axo-axonic: axon-axon
-   Action potential (electric & chemical signal in axon)
    -   "all or none"
    -   Threshold of excitation must be met to fire an action potential
    -   Refractory period - interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated
        -   Absolute: no matter how large stimulus is applied
        -   Relative: depends on stimulus size
-   Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) & inhibitory postsynaptive potential (IPSP)
    -   Electrical and chemical signals
    -   Only if EPSP > IPSP and reach threshold of excitation, then action potential in the 2nd neuron

### Neurotransmitters

-   At terminal buttons, there are vesicles full of chemicals called neurotransmitters
-   When action potential reaches the terminal buttons, exocytosis is triggered to occur (where the neurotransmitter is released from the vesicle)
-   Neurotransmitter diffuses across synapse from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron
-   Neurotransmitter finds receptors that it matches and binds to "binding site" of receptor
-   Binding causes either an excitatory postsynaptic potential or inhibitory postsynaptic potential
-   Neurotransmitter unbinds from receptor and reuptake/ enzymatic degradation occurs

#### Common Neurotransmitters

-   Agonist (increases activity) vs. antagonist (decreases activity)
-   GABA (inhibitory) vs glutamate (excitatory)
-   Acetylcholine/ ach/ cholinergic
    -   Binds with PNS: muscle contractions
    -   Binds with CNS: arousal, attention, learning
-   Monoamine -> catecholamine
    -   Dopamine/ DA
        -   Binds with CNS: movmenets, addictions, mood
    -   Norepinephrine/ NE
        -   Binds with CNS: mood, arousal
    -   Epinephrine/ Epi/ adrenergic (works on adrenaline)
        -   Binds with PNS: cardiac contraction
        -   Binds with CNS: mood
-   Monoamine -> indolamine
    -   Serotonin/ 5-HT/ serotonergic
        -   Binds with CNS: sleep/ arousal, mood, eating, aggression, impulsivity
-   Endorphins (endogenous + morphine)
    -   Type of neuropeptide to modulate pain

### Organization of Nervous System

![organizationOfNervousSystem.png](organizationOfNervousSystem.png)

-   CNS: central nervous system (spinal cord)
-   PNS: peripheral nervous system; lies outside brain and spinal cord
-   Afferent: "approaching" the brain
-   Efferent: "exiting" the brain

### Methods to Study Brain

-   Lesioning (controlled damage)
    -   Via knife cut, electrolytic lesion
-   Stimulation
    -   Via electrical stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, chemical stimulation
-   Brain imaging
    -   Tools which give structural information: CT scan, MRI
    -   Tools which give functional information: PET scan (measures blood flow)
    -   Tools which give both: fMRI (measures blood flow and oxygen)

### Development of Nervous System

-   Neural tube development (~24 days)
    -   Neural tube defect: spina bifida, anecephaly
    -   Advised to take folic acid which is in prenatal vitamins
-   Neural tube continues to swell and grow
    -   Forebrain, mid brain, hindbrain and hollow center
    -   Telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon (midbrain), metencephalon, myelencephalon (medulla)
    -   Telencephalon grows so much
-   Ventricles and central spinal fluid (CSF)
    -   Hollow areas filled with fluid CSF
    -   Cushions the brain inside and out

### Brain Physiology and Anatomy

-   Medial and lower in the brain -> primitive/ vital functions
-   Higher and outer areas of brain -> highest level of brain functions
-   **Hindbrain** (very base of the brain)
    -   medulla (connection between the brainstem and the spinal cord) - pons (relay signal below neck)
    -   cerebellum (controls balance for walking and standing, and other complex motor functions)
    -   reticular formation (major integration and relay center for many vital brain systems)
        -   ascending fibers: wakefulness/sleep
        -   descending fibers: motor movement
        -   aka reticular activating system
-   **Midbrain**
    -   visual information: superior colliculi
    -   auditory information: inferior colliculi
    -   DA-producing neurons: substantia nigra
    -   periaqueductal gray: area of brain involved with modulation of pain perception. For example, opioids can be released in this area and this leads to decreased perception of pain.
    -   periaqueductal gray: area of brain involved with modulation of pain perception
    -   reticular formation
-   **Forebrain**
    -   cerebral hemispheres
    -   corpus callosum
        -   split-brain research
    -   thalamus
        -   "sensory relay station" since all sensory information goes here before going to primary cortices, exception: olfactory
    -   hypothalamus
        -   controls pituitary in endocrine system which releases oxytocin to help women give birth and bond emotional
    -   limbic system
        -   network of different brain structures
    -   cerebral cortex (known as gray matter)
        -   higher mental functions are done
        -   sulcus/ sulci: a groove
        -   gyri: bump or ridge
        -   fissure: deep groove
        -   occipital lobe: houses primary visual cortex
        -   temporal lobe: houses primary auditory cortex
        -   parietal lobe: houses primary somatosensory cortex
        -   frontal lobe: houses primary motor cortex + mirror neurons + prefrontal lobe (executive functions)

### Hereditary studies

-   Three ways to estimate heritability:
    -   Family studies
        -   flaw: families do not share just genes, but also environment
    -   Twin studies
        -   flaw: the assumption that MZ and DZ twins only differ in terms of genes may be invalid; it’s possible that they experience different environments as well
    -   Adoption studies
        -   twin adoption study method: gather MZ & DZ twins who have been reared apart; compare concordance rate (of the target behavior) between the MZ & DZ twins
        -   flaw: sample sizes tend to be too small (esp. with the twin adoption study method)
        -   flaw: separating the twins does not ensure that they experience dissimilar environments (e.g., again, if they look alike, they may evoke the same social environment)
-   Epigenetics (heriditary changes in the characteristics of a cell or organism that result from altered gene expression or other effects not involving changes to the DNA sequence itself) marks can be passed down generations

### The Evolutionary Bases of Behavior

-   Darwin: traits which provide either **survival advantage** or **reproductive advantage** are much more likely to be “selected” over time (via natural selection)
-   Behavioral traits are subject to natural selection as well
    -   Population vs. individual organisms

## 4. Sensation and Perception

### Visual System

-   Stimulus: electromagnetic radiation between 480nm - 760nm
    -   Properties: wavelength, amplitude, purity (saturation)
-   Anatomy & physiology of the eye
    -   Cornea -> pupil/ iris -> lens -> vitreous humor -> retina (bipolar cells -> ganglion cells -> photoreceptors, rods and cones)
-   Transduction: process by which a stimulus is represented neurally
-   Photoreceptors
    -   | Rods                                | Cones                                                            |
        | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Scotopic                            | Photopic                                                         |
        | Perceives general form (not detail) | Greater visual acuity                                            |
        | More numerous than cones            | Less numerous than rods                                          |
        | More in the periphery of the retina | More in center of retina and there are only cones in the fovea   |
        | More thoroughly adapts to the dark  | Quickly adapts to the dark, but is limited in how much it adapts |
-   Receptive field: portion of the visual field which a neuron "monitors"

#### Visual Pathway

-   After light is transduced by cones/ rods, visual information processed:
    -   Bipolar cells
    -   Ganglion cells
    -   Optic disk (has optic nerves to transfer signals to the brain)
-   Information received by the halves of the retina closer to the nose
    -   crosses to the other side of the brain to form the optic chiasm (contralateral connection)
    -   dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
    -   primary visual cortex (in occipital lobe) aka V1 aka striate cortex
-   Information received by the halves of the retina farthest from the nose
    -   stays on the same side of the brain (ipsilateral connection)
    -   dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
    -   primary visual cortex (in occipital lobe) aka V1 aka striate cortex
-   In the primary visual cortex
    -   Simple cells: detect orientation of line and location of the line within its receptive field
    -   Complex cells: detect orientation of line, movement of line
-   Visual information goes to the
    -   WHAT pathway: lower part of temporal lobe, analyzes what the object is
    -   WHERE pathway: parietal lobe, analyzes where the object is

#### Theories of Color

-   Trichromatic theory (proposed by Young, refined by Helmholtz)
    -   Brain detects 3 main colors, and variations of them will give colors of the rainbow
-   Opponent process theory (proposed by Hering)
    -   Neurons that can communicate to the brain that can see one color at one time (seeing one color takes opposing or opposite actions, cannot have two at the same time)
    -   Explains complementary afterimages (rebound effect: staring at a waterfall will make things look like they are elevated)

#### Perceiving Form

-   Bottom-up processing (aka feature detection)
    -   Basic visual information are compiled so that visual cortical cells
-   Top-down processing (information is taken as a "whole")
    -   See structure and patterns in order for us to better understand the environment
    -   Gestalt principles: similarity, continuation, closure, proximity, figure/ground, and symmetry & order
-   Stroop effect: naming color when spelt another color (interference of the processes)
-   Depth perception
    -   Monocular cues: accomodation of one eye
    -   Binocular cues: retinal disparaity used to calculate depth; slight difference in images received by each eye due to horizontal separation

### Auditory System

-   Stimulus: sound (compression and decompression of molecules)
-   Properties: wavelength, amplitude, purity (timbre, quality of sound)
-   Anatomy of ear:
    -   Outer ear (ear canal/ pinna) -> middle ear (ear drum/ tympanic membrane -> ossicles) -> inner eat (oval window of cochlea)
    -   Cochlea
        -   3 canals: in the middle canal is the basiclar membrane (with auditory hair cells)
        -   Vibration moves the fluid, and basilar membrane moves
        -   Auditory hair cells fire action potential
-   Place theory
    -   Different waveforms stimulate different areas of the basilar membrane
    -   Higher frequencies stimulate basilar membrane areas closest to oval window, vice-versa
-   Frequency theory
    -   Basilar membrane mimics the sound waveform
    -   Neurons at the end of the basilar membrane fire in synchrony with waveform

### Vestibular System

-   Sense of balance
-   Stimulus: gravitational pull
-   Anatomy of vestibular system
    -   Located in inner ear near the cochlea
    -   Has semiciruclar canals and vestibular sacs

### Gustatory System

-   Stimulus: molecules dissolved in fluid
-   Anatomy of tongue:
    -   Papillae = bumps
    -   Taste buds (many on sides of papillae)
-   Primary cortex: insular cortex in frontal lobe

### Olfactory System

-   Stimulus: molecules in air
-   Anatomy of nose:
    -   Air -> mucous -> olfactory dedrites (transduction occurs)
-   Primary cortex: olfactory bulb (temporal lobe)

### Somatosensory System

-   Stimulus: mechanical, thermal, chemical
-   Anatomical system involed: nerves in th ebody
    -   Mechanoreceptors: ruffini endings, merkel’s discs, pacinian corpuscles, meissner’s corpuscle, hair shaft sensory receptor
    -   Nociceptors: free nerve endings
    -   Thermoreceptors
    -   Proprioceptors
-   Pain
    -   Stimulus: something noxious or damaging to tissues (exception: some forms of chronic pain)
    -   Anatomy of pain system: noniceptors
        -   C fibers: slow pathway (e.g., dull, aching)
        -   A-delta fibers: fast pathway (e.g., sharp pain of a knife cut)
    -   Gate control theory by Melzack and Wall (theory of how we modulate pain)
        -   Triggers: central nervous system (brain can send stimulation to close pain gates)
        -   Peripheral nervous system (rubbing area around an injury works, because other sematosensory nerves are stimulated in that area, synapses - pain & rubbing - compete to get to the spinal cord, stopping pain)
